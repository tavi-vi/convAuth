I made this out of frustration regarding the lack of simple login solutions. You could use something like [vouch-proxy](https://github.com/vouch/vouch-proxy), and this project is similar to it in that it relies on nginx (or other proxy that works like nginx). The goal is to be http basic auth, but more secure, hence the name of this project: Convoluted Auth.

I can't really recommend using this, I've written it correctly to the best of my ability, but there maybe be some bad bugs. And if this sentence is still in the README, I haven't finished it yet.
